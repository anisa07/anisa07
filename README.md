### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me

I work as a Frontender [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anisa-askarova-b94878110) and being a self-taught developer still learning how to do it better. 

In 2022 I compared different libraries such as styled components, chakra ui and tailwind. Tailwind seems super easy, but my react components look so verbose. Chakra UI is awesome, creating custom themes, switching between them is amazing. But my favorite is styled components, maybe it is a bit harder then chakra but it is so consice in components and so readable with good names.       
Just I finished my kanban board with DnD and Firestore, this task could be found in https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/kanban-task-management-web-app-wgQLt-HlbB, repository https://github.com/anisa07/dashboard
